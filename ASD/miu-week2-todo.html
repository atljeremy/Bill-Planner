MIU Week 2 TODO:


Choice: Item Details

√ Right way = Drilldown pattern
√ wrong way = list inlay pattern

  What happens when the user selects an item in a list? Does it make more sense for your application to replace the list with the item details, or should the item expand to include its details inline with the list? The first is the One-Window Drilldown pattern, while the second is the List Inlay pattern.
  Research both patterns and decide which is more appropriate for your application. Implement both patterns, one in your Right app and one in your Wrong app.


Choice: Images

√  Right way = Thumbnail + Text
√ Wrong way = Filmstrip pattern

  Images help provide context and meaning to items, but different types of items use images differently. Are the images ancillary to the textual data within the item, or are images the primary focus of the item? Would it me more appropriate to use more space for the image or for the text? Research the Thumbnail + Text, Thumbnail Grid, and Filmstrip patterns. Implement one pattern in your Right app and one in your Wrong app.


Choice: Order

√ Right way = By Due Date, Closest First
√ Wrong way = No order

  What is the most logical order to display the items in your list? Does it make more sense to display them alphabetically, according to some numeric quantity, or chronologically? Research the News Stream pattern and decide if it is appropriate for your application. Implement it in either your Right or Wrong app.
